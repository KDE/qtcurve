   Thanks to Lars Wendler for noticing this.
5. Qt4: Fix compile without Qt
6. Relicense under LGPL. With permission from all contributors in the git log.
7. Qt: Treat `Qt::Sheet` as `Qt::Dialog`. This fixes translucent background for
   close confirmation dialog in QtDesigner.
8. Remove backward compatible options.
9. Qt5: Introduce `prePolish()` to Workaround a bug in Qt5 which make it
   impossible for QMainWindow and QDialog to be transparent.
   [Qt-Bug](https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-34064)
10. Qt4: Fix compilation without X11 enabled.
11. Qt4: Use `prePolish()` in qt4, this fixes most of application crashes.

    problems on my Intel card. This is also necessary for the Gtk3 port. If
    it was really a bug of the Intel driver, it should rather be fixed there.
20. Qt: Remove `QTC_QT4_OLD_NVIDIA_ARROW_FIX` and
    `QTC_QT5_OLD_NVIDIA_ARROW_FIX`. They honestly only make things worse. Again,
    if it was really a bug of the driver, it should rather be fixed there.
21. Reorganize directories.

    Gtk2 and Gtk3).

29. `QTC_ENABLE_X11` have not effect on any modules other than
    `libqtcurve-utils.so` also making `libqtcurve-utils.so` API and ABI
    compatible with and without X11 enabled.
30. Gtk2: Workaround buggy signal handler in applications.
    [QtCurve-Bug](https://github.com/QtCurve/qtcurve/issues/41)

10. Fix buttons in chromium's menu - mouse over colour, and text colour when
    using darker colour schemes.

11. Add warning about opacity settings and compiz.
12. Fix drawing of background images onto titlebar.

## 1.7.1-gtk2

3. Remove resize grips - kwin handles this.

14. Workaround kcmshell terminating immediately after QtCurve config dialog is
    closed - increase `KGlobal` reference count.
15. When shading tab background, use `fillRect()` and not `fillPath()` -
    seems to workaround glithches with intel 2.12 graphics driver.
16. Fix kwin option to only apply opacity to titlebar.
17. Add option to control whether window titlebars are filled with the
    background *before* the titlebar gradient is applied.

8. Add position setting for background image; top left, top middle, top right,
   bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right, left middle, right middle, and
   centred.
9. Use square tooltips by default. (Problems have been reported with Pidgin and
   rounded tooltip - but I cannot reproduce these!)

11. Fix reading of QtCurve supplied default kdeglobals file.
12. Fix rounding of troughs of progressbars within treeview.
13. When using glow focus, dont draw glow focus and line focus on button of
